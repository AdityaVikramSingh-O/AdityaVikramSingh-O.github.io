<span class="n" >
</br>

    Our sense of self influences our thoughts Restricts it from being a valuable resource rather than a thing just to satisfy your self 
    
    But what about thinking about topic in which our sense of self will not interfere –like math or science – it will get attached to the process of thinking [ if you are able to think easily sense of achievement may arise  or making the mind confused and tired when solving an unclear problem ] , there is extra processing as it has to be processed by the self –the information goes to the self the self analyzes, feels then imagines and influences what it will like next + leaving an impression on the mind of the experience which makes it very slow  
    
    Not needing extra processing makes the mind less tired
