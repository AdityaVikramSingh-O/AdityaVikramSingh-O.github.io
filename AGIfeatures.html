            <h2>Key Features of Advanced AI</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conclusion Memory & Jump Thinking:</strong> AI should recall past conclusions dynamically and adapt thinking strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Generalization from Few Examples:</strong> AI must extract patterns with minimal data.</li>
                <li><strong>Recall Trigger & Connection Recognition:</strong> Just like humans, AI should trigger relevant memories when recognizing patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Optimization & Knowledge Restructuring:</strong> The AI should evolve autonomously based on new data.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Restructuring Architectures:</strong> Mechanisms like self-attention in transformers enable adaptive learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Probabilistic Reasoning:</strong> Bayesian models & uncertainty-aware transformers refine AI decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> AI should adapt dynamically to complex environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Causal Understanding:</strong> AI must integrate causal inference models (e.g., Judea Pearl’s frameworks).</li>
                <li><strong>Symbolic-Connectionist Hybrid Models:</strong> Combining neural networks with abstract reasoning enhances intelligence.</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract Linking & Thought Optimization:</strong> Just as humans make intuitive leaps, AI should optimize processing efficiency while mitigating false knowledge.</li>

            <h2>AGI Research & Development</h2>
            <p>Researching AGI isn’t just about replicating specific human outputs. Instead, it's about replicating the <strong>totality</strong> of human cognitive abilities.</p>
            <p>Human-like capabilities are essential—not just human-like outputs.</p>
            <p>For example, LLMs can recall and answer questions, but they lack:</p>
